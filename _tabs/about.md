*Dear Visitor,*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*A warm welcome to my personal blog. I hope this message finds you well.*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*My name is York Waugh—a pseudonym I’ve adopted based on the pronunciation of my real Chinese name—and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am a twenty-year-old from [Changzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changzhou), currently reading for a degree in Computer Science at [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/).*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Although my field of study is technical, I would describe myself as fairly laid-back and often guided by instinct. Whilst my general outlook is rather conservative, I remain open-minded, respect differing viewpoints, and welcome new experiences. My interests lie in technology and digital innovation, but I also have a great fondness for anime, video games, and music. In fact, I find that light-hearted, uplifting anime and gentle, soothing music provide a wonderful escape, helping me to relax and unwind from the trivialities of daily life.*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Here, I occasionally share some of my thoughts and stories. You are most welcome to contact me via the link in the bottom left-hand corner. As I am somewhat introverted, I would be grateful if you could kindly introduce yourself and the purpose of your message, as this helps me greatly in responding to new people.*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Thank you for taking the time to visit. I do hope you enjoy your stay.*  
  
*Kind regards,*
