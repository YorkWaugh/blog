### *Dear Visitors:*

*Hello! My name is  York Waugh . It's a pleasure to meet you!*  
  

*A warm welcome to my personal blog, where I shall occasionally share my musings and stories.*  
  

*I am 20 years of age, born in Changzhou, Jiangsu, China, and I am presently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at  [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/) . Should you wish to get in touch, kindly make use of the link in the lower-left corner of this site.*  
  

*A little about myself: I have a passion for digital technology, music, and animation. I am also an avid gamer; some of my favourite games include  Minecraft ,  Blue Archive ,  Reverse 1999 , the GTA series, Pokemon from the Gameboy era, and Rayark's Deemo and  Cytus . Music plays an important role in my life, with a particular fondness for the compositions of Debussy and  Strauss , as well as soft rock from artists such as  Richard Marx ,  Air Supply ,  Bertie Higgins ,  Chicago , and  Coldplay .*  
  

*I am most grateful for your visit, and I do hope you enjoy your stay.*  
  
  
*Kind regards,*  
*York Waugh*
