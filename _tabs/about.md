*Dear Visitors,*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*I hope this message finds you well. My name is York Waugh, and it is a pleasure to meet you.*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*This is my personal blog, where I occasionally share thoughts and stories. You are welcome to reach out to me via the link in the bottom left corner of the page. If this is our first interaction, I kindly request that you introduce yourself and mention the purpose of your message, as I tend to be somewhat introverted and may find it difficult to respond to unexpected greetings from unfamiliar individuals.*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*I am 20 years old, born in [Changzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changzhou), China, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/). Although I am an engineering student, I would describe myself as fairly relaxed and often guided by my instincts. While my outlook on life is generally more conservative, I am open to and respectful of diverse viewpoints and welcome new experiences. I have a strong interest in technology and digital innovation, and I also enjoy anime, video games, and music. Recently, I have been playing games such as Blue Archive and Reverse 1999 in the ACG genre, rhythm games like Deemo and Cytus, as well as Minecraft. My musical tastes include classical composers such as Debussy and the Strauss family, as well as soft rock artists like Air Supply, Bertie Higgins, Coldplay, and Richard Marx.*  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. I sincerely hope you enjoy your time here.*  
  
*Kind regards,*
