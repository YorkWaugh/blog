&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Alright, this is my first blog post. It’s not the first time I’ve thought about starting a blog, but with all the daily distractions—and my own laziness and spontaneity—it kept getting postponed until now. These past few days, Canton has been enjoying a rare touch of autumn coolness in September. The pleasant weather, along with some unexpected free time, inspired me to finally check this off my list.  
  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I used to think setting up a website would be difficult. I still remember the painstaking effort of using Dreamweaver to create a webpage back in elementary school. But with tools like Jekyll and platforms like GitHub Pages, creating a blog has become incredibly simple. Special thanks to Cotes Chung for designing the Chirpy theme, which aligns perfectly with my “simple is best” philosophy.  
  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I’m not sure when I’ll write my next post, but hey, it’s not a bad thing to take life as it comes. So, here it is—Hello, World!
